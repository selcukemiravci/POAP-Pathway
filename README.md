Drawing on the successful experience from the XRPL Pioneers project, POAP Pathway aims to be a cutting-edge PWA app integrating Thirdweb and the XRPL EVM-side chain.

## üìñ Background

PWAs are web applications that operate like regular websites but boast of functionalities typically reserved for native mobile apps, such as offline functionality, push notifications, and device hardware access. Their rising popularity in the Web3.0 ecosystem stems from their ability to bridge the gap between web and native applications, providing a unified user experience.

Platforms like Friend.tech have paved the way, demonstrating the untapped potential of decentralized social networks in the Web3.0 realm. Their innovative model, where one can invest in a friend's social network and tokenize their credibility, hints at the transformative nature of Web3.0.
